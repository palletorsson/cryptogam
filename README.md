# cryptogam

The artistic research project Cryptogam aims to create artworks that fundamentally challenge the boundaries of their own technical system, thus aiming to reflect contemporary digital conditions while expanding the understanding of our common techno-social interfaces.

The background of the research is the increasingly unstable relation between systems, algorithms and democracy that take place today. A development that needs to be understood to expand create and democratic possibilities. Through artwork and the research method, an expanding technical horizon is explored which determines how we understand out common socio-technical interfaces, as both creative and critical tools, social infrastructure and ideology.

Artwork, methodology and research are realized in a context of activist co-design, in Konstfack's unique medialab or hackerspace. The process addresses open platforms, decentralized problem solving, iterative design and peer groups, to drive the project. The theme of the research is linked to discussions that raise the importance of open technical systems to increase social mobility. The idea is that understanding the technology's "black box" not only promotes new knowledge but can also lead to more socially sustainable processes.

Several national and international, institutions, artists, social scientists and programmers are invited in specific parts of the project to deepen and expand the research.
