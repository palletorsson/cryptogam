# Cryptogam, a feasibility study for an artistic research project.

Welcome to the feasibility study for the 3-year artistic research project "Tech From the Inside Out".

The study includes three different cases and several sketches. The study is completed, but the individual projects will continue. At the moment, the project "Radical Inside" is in a peer review process for the VIS â€“ Nordic Journal for Artistic Research.

Abstract:

The 3-year artistic research project explores and sheds light on the heavily invisible production of social media platforms and software by turning them inside out. The goal is to make artworks self-reflective and even self-aware. First, the research bends and hack the system to reveal its hidden and queer sides. The outcome is at least six significant works that are speculative and mind-blowing and shows how our political and creative agency can have more freedom. From this point, a methodological and theoretical exploration runs in parallel and to raise the complexity and keep the low threshold of engagement. Within a reference group, the artworks are discussed on transparency, understanding and inclusion, norm criticism, and reproducibility to ensure lasting impact. The central outcome is an archive of artworks showing strategies with in-depth instructions that anyone can build on. For artists working in this field, the research is a unique resource. Exhibitions of the work nationally and internationally is an important outcome. The last step is to deepen and disseminating the arguments about the possibilities of the new catalog in publications. By understanding these technologies better, we become more tech-literate and can start to address and understand how ubiquitous software structure society. The importance of creating works of art that can show that, despite our locking systems, we have freedom, enabling a more accessible, creative, queer, and democratic future.
