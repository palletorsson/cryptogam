# Radical Inside : Tutorial 1 

- This tutorial explores how to make animation inside the 3d-models of the website sketchfab.com.

- The sketchfab viewer api are used for the exploration.  

## Inital setup
- The code is a webpage and runs in a webbrowser 
- To make a webpage we use a combination of html, css and javascript.

- Lets start by making the html document, with the necessary html.
- Paste the boilerplate code below into a code editor

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- add sketchfab library here -->
</head>

<body>

</body>
</html>
```


### Html structure
- The boilerplate webpage has an autonomy consisting of html element (<html>) and inside that element a head (<head>) and a body (<body>).

- in the head we will link to the javascript library so we can use its 3D functions.

- in the body we will add an iframe, a webpage within a webpage, where the animations will play.

- lastly at the end of the body we will link to the javascript that will take care of the interaction.


// now we have link the libery with the webpage and the interative code.
// save the document och open up a new document
