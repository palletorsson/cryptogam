# Radical Inside : Tutorial 1 

- This tutorial explores how to make animation inside the 3d-models of the website sketchfab.com.

- The sketchfab viewer api are used for the exploration.  

## Inital setup
- The code is a webpage and run in a webbrowser 
- To make a webpage we use a combination of html, css and javascript.

- Let start with the necessary html.
- Paste som boilerplate code into this document

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>

<body>

</body>
</html>
```



- the webpage has an autonomy consisting of html element and inside that element a head and a body.

- in the head we will link to the javascript library so we can use its 3D functions.

- in the body we will add an iframe, a webpage within a webpage, where the animations will play.

* lastly at the end of the body we will link to the javascript that will take care of the interaction.


// now we have link the libery with the webpage and the interative code.
