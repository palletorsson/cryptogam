* to connect the imaginary relation between bodies, our own and
* what Donna Haraway world call kin, becoming other, order.

2. The 3d plattform sketchfab can works in your browser, a browser that reads webpages.
* To make a webpage we use a combination of html and javascript.

3. Let start with the necessary html.
* Paste som boilerplate code into this document

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>

<body>

</body>
</html>
```

<!--

* the webpage has an autonomy consisting of html element and inside that element a head and a body.

* in the head we will link to the javascript library so we can use its 3D functions.

* in the body we will add an iframe, a webpage within a webpage, where the animations will play.

* lastly at the end of the body we will link to the javascript that will take care of the interaction.
