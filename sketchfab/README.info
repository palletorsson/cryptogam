The Inner beauty of SketchFab 3D models

In the current work I use, an online marketplace for 3D models - sketchfab.com - to draw attention to how the 3D models of the site share a common power and beauty. The 3D models are constituted by the same, digital materiality and visual algorithms - Webgl. The framework for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser. Through the artwork I want to share the power and beauty by turning away from the models exterior where their visual clich√©s are in focus. A possibility that can be manifested with the help of some alteration presented in this paper, a possibility that lay close beyond the visual surface. Like for humans, I assume that the 3D models power reside in their common material connectedness and not only in how they differ, not only how they can be distinguished as product or difference. 

Video of proof of concept, coming soon...
