The Inner beauty of SketchFab 3D models

Abstract



The goal of this work, as well as my research, is to expand our understanding of contemporary creative conditions concerning how technologically constructed systems enable cultural production. The work explores specific systems and pushes their intended use.



In the process, I also hope to reveal the relationship between digital systems and transformative subjects. The work, Radical Inside, explores 3D models from the biggest sharing platform for 3D content. As the shift in camera perspective reveals the inside structure of the 3D models, a multiplicity of possibilities opens up. The reorientation points to criticism of how society is structured and imagined by the heteronormative gaze. The unusual angle displaces the normative placement of the model within a reduced and rigid system - the taxonomy and categorization of the platform. From within, I can highlight and explore technology as a fundamentally surreal and queer possibility.
